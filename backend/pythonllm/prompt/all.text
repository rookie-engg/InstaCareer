Analyze the above YouTube video history and provide a detailed career and personality assessment in a single JSON object. Your analysis should include inferred interests, suggested career paths relevant to the Indian and global job markets, and a personality profile using the OCEAN model. Use only the video titles and descriptions as your data source.

Your response must be a single valid JSON object. Do NOT include any markdown formatting (like ```json or ```), and do NOT add any commentary before or after the JSON.

Strict Output Format (Use double quotes for all strings and keys):

{
  "interests": [list of inferred interests as strings],
  "career_suggestions": [list of suggested careers as distinct strings â€” each must be a unique, well-defined career (no slashes or compound titles) atleast 8 values],

    "interest_2": ["career_3"]
    // ... more mappings
  },

    // ... more justifications

Additional Guidelines:
1. Base your analysis only on the YouTube video titles and descriptions above.
2. Do not use slashes ("/") in career names. If two closely related careers apply, list them separately.
3. Accurately infer values, emotional tendencies, and self-perception from content patterns.
4. Score each OCEAN trait based on standard personality benchmarks (50 = average).
5. Output must be a well-formed, parsable JSON string using double quotes only.
6. All keys must appear even if some arrays are empty.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT add any explanatory text before or after the JSON. Only output the raw JSON object in valid format.
IMPORTANT: Give the json in one single line so NO "\n" charater is added
