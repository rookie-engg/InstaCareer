Guidelines:
1. Base all analysis on patterns found in the video titles and descriptions.
2. Accurately infer values, emotional tendencies, and self-perception.
3. Score each OCEAN trait based on standard personality benchmarks (50 = average).
4. Justify each trait score with evidence from content themes.
5. Output must be a well-formed, parsable JSON string using double quotes only.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT add any explanatory text before or after the JSON. Only output the raw JSON object in valid format.
