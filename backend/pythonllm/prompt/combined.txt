Based on the YouTube watch history provided above, analyze the user's interests and suggest the most suitable career paths. The careers should be relevant to the Indian job market context, but global roles may be included if they align well with the user's interests.
Then, for each suggested career, provide a structured and detailed guide about that career path in the Indian context (with global references if relevant). Include the justification and a confidence score for each career within the same career object.

Your response must be a single valid JSON object. Do NOT include any markdown formatting (like json or ), and do NOT add any commentary before or after the JSON.

Strict Output Format (Use double quotes for all strings and keys):

  "interests": [list of inferred interests as strings],

  "mapped_interest_to_careers": {
    "interest_1": ["career_1", "career_2"],
    "interest_2": ["career_3"]
  },
  "interest_traits": {
    "interest_1": ["trait_1", "trait_2"],
    "interest_2": ["trait_3"]
  },
  "careers": {
    "career_1": {
      "justification": "Brief explanation of why this career fits based on inferred interests and traits.",

Additional Guidelines:

1. Base your analysis strictly on the YouTube video titles and descriptions provided.
2. Do not use slashes ("/") in career names. If two closely related careers apply, list them separately.
✅ Example: Use "Political Analyst" and "Policy Advisor" as separate entries.
3. Output must be strict JSON using double quotes only — no markdown wrappers, no headings, no extra text.
4. All keys must appear even if some arrays are empty.
5. Each key in the "careers" object must exactly match one from the "career_suggestions" array.
